# Handshake
Handshake is a decentralized, permissionless blockchain project that aims to revolutionize the way the domain name system (DNS) works on the internet. It specifically focuses on the decentralization of top-level domains (TLDs), which are the suffixes in domain names (like .com, .org, .net, etc.).

Here's a breakdown of what Handshake is and how it works:

1. ### What is Handshake?
    - **Decentralized Domain Name System (DNS)**: Handshake's primary goal is to provide a decentralized and trustless alternative to the existing DNS system, which is currently managed by centralized authorities like ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

    - **Blockchain-based TLD Management**: It allows individuals to own, buy, sell, and manage TLDs on the blockchain, removing the need for centralized organizations. This aims to make the internet more censorship-resistant and secure.

2. ### How Handshake Works
    - **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: In the traditional DNS system, TLDs like .com, .org, and .net are managed by ICANN. Handshake allows anyone to bid for and control a TLD on a decentralized, blockchain-powered platform.
    For example:

        - Instead of purchasing a .com domain from a registrar, you could bid for ownership of the .com TLD itself on the Handshake network.

    - **Bidding Process**:

        - Handshake uses an auction system where participants can bid HNS (Handshake’s native cryptocurrency) for TLDs. The person who wins the auction becomes the owner of that TLD for a set period.

        - Once you control a TLD, you can issue domain names under it (e.g., mydomain.com) and control the DNS records associated with those domains.

    - **Censorship Resistance**:

        - By using blockchain technology, Handshake ensures that TLD ownership is censorship-resistant. No central authority (like ICANN) can change or seize ownership of TLDs, unlike the current centralized DNS system.

    - **DNS Resolution**:

        - Handshake is not intended to replace the entire DNS system; instead, it works alongside existing DNS infrastructure. It provides a decentralized and more secure alternative for domain resolution, especially for TLDs controlled by Handshake.

3. ### Key Features of Handshake
    - **Decentralization**: Unlike the current DNS system, which is centralized, Handshake operates on a decentralized network where ownership and control of domain names are distributed among participants.

    - **Censorship-Resistant**: Because it is decentralized, Handshake prevents governments or organizations from seizing or censoring domain names. This is a major advantage in situations where free speech or internet freedom is at risk.

    - **Security**: By utilizing blockchain technology, Handshake provides enhanced security features, such as immutability and transparency in TLD ownership.

4. ### HNS: Handshake’s Native Cryptocurrency
    - **HNS** is the native cryptocurrency of the Handshake network. It is used for:

        - Bidding on TLDs during the auction process.

        - Transferring ownership of TLDs.

        - Paying for domain registration and other network-related operations.

    - **Fixed Supply**: HNS has a fixed total supply, similar to Bitcoin. This is designed to prevent inflation and ensure scarcity.

5. ### Handshake vs. Traditional Domain Systems
    - **Traditional Domain System**: Currently, domains like .com and .org are owned and controlled by centralized organizations, primarily ICANN and domain registrars. These systems are vulnerable to censorship, seizure, and manipulation.

    - **Handshake’s Blockchain Approach**: With Handshake, ownership of TLDs is decentralized and secured by the blockchain. This means no single entity can control or modify the ownership of domains in a way that isn’t transparent or verifiable.

6. ### Use Cases
    - **Ownership of Top-Level Domains**: Users can own TLDs like .example or .crypto on the Handshake blockchain.

    - **Domain Name Registration**: Just like traditional domain registrars, users can register subdomains under these TLDs.

    - **Websites & Services**: Developers and individuals can host websites, services, and applications using these decentralized TLDs.

    - **Censorship-Resistant Internet**: Handshake aims to create a more open and free internet by making domain ownership uncensorable.

7. ### Advantages of Handshake
    - **Freedom**: Handshake gives users more control over domain names and the infrastructure of the internet.

    - **Security**: With blockchain's immutability and encryption, domain ownership and DNS records are highly secure.

    - **No Central Authority**: It removes the reliance on centralized authorities (like ICANN) for domain name registration, making the internet more democratic.

## Summary
In short, **Handshake** is a decentralized blockchain designed to overhaul the way domain names and the DNS system operate. By allowing users to own and control top-level domains on a blockchain, it aims to make the internet more open, secure, and censorship-resistant. The Handshake network achieves this by using its native cryptocurrency, HNS, for domain auctions, and by leveraging blockchain technology for transparency and immutability.
